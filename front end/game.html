        <p class="text-white">UNO is a multi-player card game in which the objective is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand.  Each player is dealt 7 cards and players take turn drawing cards from the deck.  If a player has a card in their hand matching the card they drew from the deck, they can play that card (helping to reduce the total cards in their hand).  If the player doesn't have a matching card in their hand, they must draw another card from the deck to add to their hand, which increases the total number of cards they need to get rid of to win.  When a player has only one card left in their hand, they must yell "UNO!," but if an opposing player notices before the original player has a chance to say "UNO," the original player must draw four more cards.</p>
